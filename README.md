### Description

This will Disolve your screen! LOL, actually it will jsut keep pixelating your screen to the point of no return! I think it'll serve as a nice way to scare someone! I'd like to thank Patrick Moore, I used his OCX thats on PSc (Image FX) to pixelate, check out his stuff! and please vote and leave feedback!
 
### More Info
 
To exit just click anywhere on the screen!
